*FAIR* is a collection of guiding principles to make data **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**e-usable. This module provides a number of lessons to ensure that a researcher's data is properly managed and published to ensure it enables reproducible research.


It is based on the lesson template used in [Neurohackweek]({{ site.nhw_site }}), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
