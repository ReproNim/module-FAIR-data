### Introduction

This lesson provides information and training on a number of research data management platforms.  In addition, this lesson provides a number of courses covering an introduction to databases as well as specific course offerings for some popular database platforms.

### Introduction

When managing data in your own laboratory, there are a number of options available to you.  First, there are a number of products (both academic and commercial) that allow you to manage your neuroimaging and associated data within their platform.

> ## Selected External Material
> #### Neuroimaging Data Platforms
> ##### XNAT:
>
>   - [XNAT](https://www.xnat.org)
>   - [XNAT GitHub](https://github.com/NrgXnat)
>
> **Overview**: XNAT is an open source imaging informatics platform developed by the Neuroinformatics Research Group at Washington University. XNAT was originally developed in the Buckner Lab at Washington University, now at Harvard University. It facilitates common management, productivity, and quality assurance tasks for imaging and associated data. Thanks to its extensibility, XNAT can be used to support a wide range of imaging-based projects.
>
> **Documentation**: Full documentation for XNAT can be found on their Wiki page (https://wiki.xnat.org/documentation)

>  - [LORIS GitHub] (https://github.com/aces/Loris)
>
> **Overview**: The Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System is a web-based data and project management software for neuroimaging research studies. It is an OPEN SOURCE framework for storing and processing behavioural, clinical, neuroimaging and genetic data. LORIS also makes it easy to manage large datasets acquired over time in a longitudinal study, or at different locations in a large multi-site study.
>
> **Documentation**: Documentation for LORIS can be found on their GitHub Wiki page (https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Setup)

> ##### FlyWheel (Commercial):
>
>  - [FlyWheel] (https://flywheel.io)
>
> **Overview**: Flywheel is a data management platform designed to ease the IT burden of the researcher by creating a collaborative environment for reproducible, computational science. Data can be uploaded directly from devices or can be manually uploaded into Flywheel. Once loaded, users can organize and search through data.

#### Build your Own...

While it is recommended that one try and utilize (and potentially contribute to) an existing platform there may still be a need to develop your own database system.  Databases and database technology are well represented in current online course offerings.  Therefor, we provide below a set of recommendations for free online courses that you can utilize.

> ## Selected External Material
> #### Introduction to Databases
> ##### Databases Self Paced MOOC at Stanford Online:
>
>   - [Databases](http://online.stanford.edu/course/databases-self-paced)
>
> **Abstract**: Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge fraction of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.

> ##### Introduction to Relational Databases at Udacity:
>
>   - [Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197)
>
> **Abstract**: This course is a quick, fun introduction to using a relational database from your code, using examples in Python. You'll learn the basics of SQL (the Structured Query Language) and database design, as well as the Python API for connecting Python code to a database. You'll also learn a bit about protecting your database-backed web apps from common security problems. (content from course site)
