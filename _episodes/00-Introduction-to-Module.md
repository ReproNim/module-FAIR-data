title: "Data and the FAIR Principles"
teaching: A FAIR bit of time.   
exercises: Will be available via specific episodes. 
questions:
- "Who is this modulde for ?"
- "How can I get some help if I get stuck on solving for an exercise or a question ?"
- "How can I validate this module ?"
- "When and where are the future ReproNim training workshops ?"


objectives:
- "Provide researchers with the proper instruction on being able to find the appropriate available data and software that can subsequently be submitted to the specified workflows and executions environments"
- "Make this a collaborative enterprise: you can improve this module if you know how to do a pull request, which is taught to you in module 'the informatics basics of reproducibility (module 0)"
- "This module should provide you with the ability work with data in a reproducible manner"


keypoints:
- This is in line with our overall goal of making science (including scientific training) more open.

### What is a ReproNim module ? 

A ReproNim module is a set of "steps" or "episodes", in which we have gathered material on the web to guide you through the acquisition of a concept or tool or technique. You will take this journey and for each episode, we try to then ask you a few questions or do some exercise so that you will have an idea of how much you feel comfortable with the material to be acquired. We are not providing the answers directly on this web site so that this can be taken as a real course, but we will be teaching workshops with the answers and we will have links to the answers.

### Who is this module for? 

The module is for you, if you are a biomedical researcher or an informatics researcher or student, is working with neuroimaging (or not) and you want to know about reproducibility and data.

### How much time this should take me? 

That really depends on your familiarity with concepts covered in the episodes and your capacity to write some code. If you have no familiarity at all, this may take you a long time, for instance 2 full weeks. If you have good familiarity, some of the information will be already partially known and it may take you a few days to go in detail through this material.

### What are the episodes for this module? 

1. Introduction to the Web of Data
2. The Scientific Data Ecosystem
3. Ethics
4. Data Publishing
5. Your Laboratory Datastore
6. Semantic Data Representations
7. Developing Your Own Data Visualizations

[//]: # Will I be done in 3 days ? No.

### Do I need to code ?  What language ? 

You can learn a lot without coding, however, some of the episodes and exercises will require some coding. So, yes, you should code. We have (mostly) adopted python for the language, it may not be your first choice but we think some knowledge of python coding will help you anyways. We will try to help as much as possible by providing tutorials, examples, and links to installation instructions.

### ReproNim is truly *open*

The ReproNim training events can only accommodate a limited number of participants.
Nevertheless, we are committed to openness and we are committed to providing our
materials in an open format, with liberal licenses, and through a publicly accessible website.
