### Introduction

We provided a very brief overview of some of the concepts involved in the semantic web and linked data in [Episode 01:  Web of Data](https://github.com/ReproNim/module-FAIR-data/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/01-Web-of-Data.md).  Please review this module if you need an introduction to concepts such as persistent identifiers, URI's, RDF and triples.  

Here we will focus specifically on a set of technologies collectively called the semantic web.  
 
> #### Lessons
An excellent set of training tools is available on these topics through [Linkeddatatools.com](http://www.linkeddatatools.com/index.php) and so we won't replicate them here. The tutorials cover:

  -  Introduction To Graph Databases - gives a brief overview of the way in which the semantic web stores data.
  -  RDF - A Quick Start - an introductory look at Resource Description Framework (RDF), the format the semantic web uses to store data in graph databases.
  -  Semantic Modeling - introduces the key aspects of describing data with meaning, or semantics - and the tremendous advantages this can offer.
  -  Introduction To RDFS & OWL - the key syntax the semantic web uses to encode semantic meaning into data.
  -  Querying Semantic Data - how to query published semantic data using SPARQL protocol - the means to harness the immense discovery capabilities of the semantic web.
