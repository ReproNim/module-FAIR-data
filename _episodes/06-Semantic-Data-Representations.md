### Introduction

We provided a very brief overview of some of the concepts involved in the semantic web and linked data in [Episode 01:  Web of Data](https://github.com/ReproNim/module-FAIR-data/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/01-Web-of-Data.md).  Please review this module if you need an introduction to concepts such as persistent identifiers, URI's, RDF and triples.  

Here we will focus specifically on a set of technologies collectively called the [semantic web](http://www.linkeddatatools.com/semantic-web-basics).  The concept of the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) was introduced by Tim Berners Lee to describe a web of data accessibly by machines through the web. The semantic web is often called web 3.0, "a way of linking data between systems or entities that allows for rich, self-describing interrelations of data available across the globe on the web" [Linked Data Tools](http://www.linkeddatatools.com/semantic-web-basics).

What does that mean exactly?  A more detailed and technical explanation is provided through the lessions below.  But in plain terms, the semantic web provides a protocol for publishing data on the web that allows machines to access them based on a set of relationships.  If fully realized, it allows bits of information about the same entity contained in different different databases, developed and maintained by different people, to be easily and automatically assembled without having to go through any manual mapping.  

The basis of this ability is the encoding of data as a graph rather than just a set of tables as is done in relational databases or spreadsheets, where each data point is connected to another data point through a specific relationship. Let's say that there are two different databases in two different locations.  One has measured gene expression in different parts of the human brain while another has brain activation as a function of region and task.  

> #### Lessons
An excellent set of tutorials is available on the semantic web and associated technologies through [Linkeddatatools.com](http://www.linkeddatatools.com/index.php) and so we won't replicate them here. The tutorials cover:

  -  Introduction To Graph Databases - gives a brief overview of the way in which the semantic web stores data.
  -  RDF - A Quick Start - an introductory look at Resource Description Framework (RDF), the format the semantic web uses to store data in graph databases.
  -  Semantic Modeling - introduces the key aspects of describing data with meaning, or semantics - and the advantages this can offer.
  -  Introduction To RDFS & OWL - the key syntax the semantic web uses to encode semantic meaning into data.
  -  Querying Semantic Data - how to query published semantic data using SPARQL protocol - the means to harness the immense discovery capabilities of the semantic web.
